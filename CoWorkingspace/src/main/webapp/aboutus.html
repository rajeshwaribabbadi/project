	<p>Coworking is not only about the physical place, but about establishing a community.Our team J51 made a project regarding this co-workspace  Indeed, its rapid growth has been seen as a possible way for city planners to address the decline of high street retail in urban centres.Its benefits can already be experienced outside of the physical spaces, and it is recommended to start with building a coworking community first before considering opening a coworking place. However, some coworking places don't build a community; they just get a part of an existing one by combining their opening with an event which attracts their target group.

  <p> Real-estate centric coworking spaces are about selling desks first, with building community as a secondary goal. Players target freelance professionals, remote workers, and small to medium enterprises (SMEs) who need a space and seek a community with a collaborative spirit. Customers also often benefit from professional services such as printing or incorporation or consulting.</p>
<p>
   Coworking is distinct from business accelerators, incubators, and executive suite.These spaces do not fit into the coworking model because they often miss the social, collaborative, and informal aspects of the process. In coworking, management practices are closer to that of a cooperative, including a focus on community rather than profit. An undercurrent among coworking participants is that they are also participants in an unconference like BarCamp and other related open-source participatory technology events.</p></h1>
